# Eye Exercise
 
## Project Description


The eye movement game allows the user to move the focus of the eye around the screen using the mouse.


As the user moves their mouse cursur around the screen, the eye will track the mouse position and adjust accordingly.


Future work may include blinking the eye using a right-click of the mouse.
